Hello everyone! The community issue I want to address is smoking on the streets.  
This issue caught my attention because cigarette smoke and dropped butts make our sidewalks dirty and harm people, which is worst for children and older neighbors.  
The project is called Clean Air Streets.  
It has two main goals: first, to stop people from smoking in busy walking areas; and second, to clean up cigarette waste and protect neighbors from smoke.  
To achieve these goals, we will ask smokers to quit and offer free help to those who try. We will make local shops put up clear no smoking signs and have city staff build small smoking spots away from sidewalks. I also invite neighbors to join clean days and tell their friends about the rules to make the change last for years to come.  
Through this project, I to emphasize the importance of clean public places, public health, and caring for one another.  
Thank you.
